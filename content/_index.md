Hey there! I thought it could be fun to make a blog, like how I started to journal. This website is *seriously* under construction right now, but it'll start to flesh out soon[^*]

I work as an iOS dev at onXmaps, but in my free time my interests include:
- Crosswords
- Running
- Linguistics
- Taylor Swift

This page was created with the help of [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and my friends! Theming inspired by [bear blog](https://bearblog.dev/).
